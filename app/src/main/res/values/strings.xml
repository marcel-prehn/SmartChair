        In this tutorial you will see some basic advices about the correct sitting position in general.\n\n
        It consists of <b>three parts</b>:\n
        1. The right angle of sitting correctly on a chair\n
        2. Not to cross your legs\n
        3. To empty your back-pockets\n
        \n
        These advices will help you to optimize the way you are sitting and to avoid uneven
        load on your backbone.

    <string name="tutorialText1">
        To support your backbone properly, you have to sit in the right angle.\n\n
        This means you should sit straight in, put your feet parallel on the ground
        and push your chest out.\n\n
        Your backbone has to be S-shaped as highlighted in the picture.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorialText2">
        To even the load on your back prevent crossing your legs.\n\n
        With your legs crossed, your backbone can not be in absolute balance.
        One side will always be more loaded than the other.\n\n
        To prevent this, you should place your feed always parallel on the ground.
    </string>
    <string name="tutorialText3">
        Uneven load on your backbone can also be caused by wearing a
        purse in your back-pocket.\n\n
        This uneven load can - similar to crossing legs - cause serious backbone
        problems by relocating your weight on one side of your body.
